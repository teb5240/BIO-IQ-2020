# Introductory-Machine-Learning-Tutoral

This is the repository containing an Introductory Machine Learning Tutorial. To complete the tutorial, one must have jupyter notebook and python3 functional locally.

# Howto: Tutorial

In order to use this tutorial, you need to be aware of two files. There are only two jupyter notebooks in this repository, `Introductory Machine Learning Tutorial.ipynb` and `Introductory Machine Learning Tutorial Solution.ipynb` By downloading or cloning the repository, and opening the solution notebook `Introductory Machine Learning Tutorial Solution.ipynb` and running it succesfully, you will confirm that you have all of the necessary software. Woohoo!

To complete the tutorial, open the notebook entitled: `Introductory Machine Learning Tutorial.ipynb` and fill in the components of the code which say `[FILL IN]`.

# Howto: Install Jupyter Notebook

I would recommend if you don't have much experience with notebooks to use Anaconda. This helps to get beginners started!
